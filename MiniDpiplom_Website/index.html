                <p>This project explores the intersection of language, aesthetics, and digital presence through an
                    interventionist approach to web typography. By animating the unseen, transitioning text strokes, and
                    embedding subtle interactions into the digital reading experience, it invites reflection on the ways
                    we
                    perceive and engage with information online.
                    <br><br>
                    In a time when <a href="">the internet</a> has become our primary library, stage, and conversation
                    space, the project
                    asks: What does it mean to read online? How do design and motion influence the weight of words? By
                    altering the familiarâ€”text as mere content deliveryâ€”it seeks to transform digital reading into a
                    sensory, reflective act. Here, even the seemingly minor properties of typography, such as stroke
                    width,
                    become dynamic, carrying metaphors for emphasis, movement, and meaning.
                    <br><br>
                    Ultimately, the project gestures toward a reimagining of how we navigate the infinite pages of the
                    web:
                    as more than consumers of information, but as participants in a living, visual dialogue between
                    language
                    and technology.
